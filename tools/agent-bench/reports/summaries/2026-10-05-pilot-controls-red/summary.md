# Agent benchmark: gpt-6-luna

Profile: pi-0.85.1+rifty-adapter-v2; task set: pilot-v1; runs/task: 1.
Limits: {"maxToolCalls":40,"runTimeoutMs":600000}.
no-COI policies: {}.
Catalog entry: {"id":"gpt-6-luna","name":"GPT-6 Luna","provider":"codex-proxy","api":"openai-completions","baseUrl":"http://127.0.0.1:10539/v1","input":["text"],"contextWindow":1000000,"maxTokens":8192,"reasoning":true,"thinking":"medium","compat":{"supportsReasoningEffort":true},"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0}}.
Source: bc1bcdb33561d2c3c5251e441b5db51f8314a7b4 (working tree modified); versions: {"node":"v24.16.0","piCli":"0.85.1","chromium":"148.0.7778.96","codexCli":"codex-cli 0.159.3"}.

Tool/context non-equivalence: shared model, Pi version and common policy do not isolate an environment-only effect. Native CLI has read/bash/edit/write and native shell; browser hosts expose their real capabilities. Full provider prompts/tool schemas are retained for Pi runs. Native Codex JSONL does not expose its assembled prompt/tool schema; that context remains unobserved.

Excluded: rifty-no-coi/node-endpoint: installed-bin resident preview only; selected trials retained.

Outcomes: pass, fail, budget-exceeded, context-exceeded (separate; never counted as ordinary fail).
Failure classes are manual: agent, rifty-runtime, rifty-tooling, ai-mode-ux, provider, task-bad. Unclassified stays null.

Native Codex reference: {"model":"gpt-6.1-sol","reasoning":"low","isolation":{"ephemeral":true,"ignoreUserConfig":true,"ignoreRules":true,"projectDocMaxBytes":0},"sandbox":"workspace-write","approval":"automatic review","budgetAdmission":"observed tool-event cancellation; may overshoot","cliVersion":"codex-cli 0.159.3"}. Separate model/context; no Pi delta.
Native Codex counters not emitted by CLI are unknown; tokens absent on incomplete turns are unknown.
Series: completed; selected 24; retained 24.
Incomplete series is partial evidence; missing work is never success.
