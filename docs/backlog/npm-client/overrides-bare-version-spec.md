title: npm's bare-version override spelling (`"vite": "8.0.16"`) resolves as a range, not a package name
created: 2026-09-15
why: npm's own overrides spelling is a bare version/range; rifty's parser treats a value without '@' as a package NAME, so `{"overrides":{"vite":"8.0.16"}}` fetches packument "8.0.16" (404) — silent misparse of a real npm manifest
user_story: As a developer pinning vite the npm way in package.json overrides, I want `npm install` to honour `"vite": "8.0.16"`, but today rifty resolves package "8.0.16" and fails with a 404

## Context

`overrides.ts` `parseTarget`: `"vite@8.0.16"` / `"npm:vite@8.0.16"` → {name, range}
(works end to end: probe installed one vite 8.0.16 for vitest's `^8` edge);
`"8.0.16"` → {name: "8.0.16", range: null} → `Failed to fetch packument 8.0.16: 404`.
Oracle (npm 11.17.0, evidence §Oracle): the same manifest on the host
resolves one hoisted `node_modules/vite@8.0.16` for vitest's `^8` edge —
a bare version is npm's own value form (alongside `$ref` and `npm:` aliases);
a bare package name is not. Only the npm
spelling needs to parse as "same name, this range"; the rifty `name@range`
extension stays. `$ref` forms remain a loud gap. Scope is this one parse
branch — no resolution/hoisting change (goal Decisions).

## Challenge

challenge: 2026-09-15 — reuse epic vitest-run-in-browser (6 problems, resolved in goal.md; P1 verified by probe)
