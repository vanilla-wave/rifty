# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial Solid UI scaffold: header + Monaco editor + xterm.js terminal in a 1:1 split, plus Run / Reset buttons.
- COOP/COEP headers in `vite.config.ts` (D-001) for cross-origin isolation, both in `server` and `preview` modes.
- Capabilities-detection fallback panel that explains which feature is missing if the browser isn't cross-origin-isolated.
- Service Worker registration on mount; failures surface in the terminal (red).
- `useRuntime` adapter as the single bridge between Solid signals and the framework-agnostic runtime controller (D-002).
- Dev proxy `/npm-registry → registry.npmjs.org` to make M9 wiring testable from day 1 (D-004).
- Runtime cross-origin-isolation guard (`assertCrossOriginIsolated` in `src/boot.ts`): if the page boots without `crossOriginIsolated === true`, paint an inline fatal banner and throw before any SAB-consuming code runs. Defence-in-depth for ADR-0002 in case COOP/COEP headers regress at the host.
- `bootstrapPlayground()` — single awaited pipeline in `src/boot.ts` that runs the COI guard, `initBackend()` (VFS), and `registerServiceWorker('/sw.js')` in order. `main.tsx` awaits it before `render(...)`, so the App always sees a fully-resolved boot bundle. Closes A-004 (REVIEW_ACTIONS): persistence wiring is in place, plus an e2e reload assertion in `tests/e2e/m0-boot.spec.ts`.

### Changed

- `App` no longer races a `registerServiceWorker()` call in `onMount`. The SW is registered by `bootstrapPlayground()` before render; failures flow through `BootResult.swError` to the existing dismissible banner. Removes the small window where the REPL was interactive but the preview iframe was not yet routable.
